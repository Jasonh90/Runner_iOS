6. List of how your app addresses each of the requirements: iOS

- We have used SnapKit to contraint each of the elements on the screen 

- The API integration allows users to currently post and view jobs. They are also able to reload jobs to be upto date with any new updated jobs

- A TableView was used in two screens. One to actually display all the jobs and the other to create jobs. 

- A navigation controller allows users to move between screens. Screens are also presented modally in this app. 

The goal of the app, would be to further implement functionality and allow users to actually accept and do jobs with OAuth!
